// ALGORITHM DESIGN : Gayle-Shapley Algorithm
/*
   1. Initially, everyone is unmarried.
   2. if unmarried man m chooses w who ranks highest in his preference list and proposes to her. 
      if the woman w is free, she temporarily pairs with m as she might not a better man.
      
   3. An arbitary free man m chooses the highest ranked woman w to whom he has not proopsed yet.
      If the woman w is free, then w amd m becomes engaged. 
      If the woman is already engaged to some other man m', she compares the rank of both and choose the higher ranking one. 
  
   4.  The algorithm terminates when none is free.

//Pseudo CODE:

/*
algorithm stable_matching is
    Initialize all m ∈ M and w ∈ W to free
    while ∃ free man m who still has a woman w to propose to do
        w := first woman on m's list to whom m has not yet proposed
        if w is free then
            (m, w) become engaged
        else some pair (m', w) already exists
            if w prefers m to m' then
                m' becomes free
                (m, w) become engaged
            else
                (m', w) remain engaged
            end if
        end if
    repeat
